# CS-330

For creating the scene project, we did the creation in interations starting with creating a window, then making one of the models, texturing the model, and finally adding lighting and creating other models within the scene. During this process I first learned and tested out these new concepts using a pyramid, playing around with each new added feature and seeing how it would react with the pyramid before adding my choice to the scene. I also used math fomulas and graphing tools to give me a rough sketch about how the coordinates I added to the scene would look, and plotting each coordinate by hand (although I should have put more focus on creating functions for common shapes to save some time).

For me, working on this project helped both understand my pace on learning new concepts and showed the importance of working a code piece by piece, as a lot of information I needed to take in week by week. This will better help my educational purpose by allowing me to better understand how much of a new language/concept I need to pace myself each day. As for a professional stand point, learning OpenGL in general allows me to transfer my knowledge to related skills such as Unreal engine and Unity, allowing me to expand my skillset in rendering not only objects but environments that could be used in other programs.
